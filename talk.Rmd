# Introduction

## Introduction

* [Open Trade Statistics](https://tradestatistics.io) (OTS) was created with the intention to lower the barrier to working with international economic trade data.

* It includes a public API, a dashboard, and an R package for data retrieval.

* The project started when I was affected by the fact that many Latin American Universities have limited or no access to the [United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database](https://comtrade.un.org/) (UN COMTRADE).

---

## Introduction

* There are alternatives to COMTRADE.

* Example: The [Base Pour L'Analyse du Commerce International](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=1) (BACI).

* BACI remarkables: It is constructed using the raw data and a method that reconciles the declarations of the exporter and the importer.

* You need UN COMTRADE institutional paid access to access BACI.

---

## Introduction

* I contacted UN COMTRADE.

* My proposal was to do something similar to BACI but available for anyone.

* COMTRADE agreed as long as it kept commercial purposes out of the scope of the project.

---

## Introduction

After many emails I got a temporary access to download the raw data.

## Introduction

The project has a major reproducibility flaw: You can reproduce the steps to
obtain the curated data if you already have the raw data.

# API

## Comparison between APIs

Similar projects:

* [The Atlas of Economic complexity](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/)
* [The Obervatory of Economic complexity](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/)

Both use UN COMTRADE data and focus on data visualization to answer questions like:

* Who imported Electronics in 1980?
* Who exported Refined Copper in 1990?
* Where did Chile export Wine to in 2016?

---

## Comparison between APIs

As a simple example, I shall compare three APIs by extracting what did Chile export to Argentina, Bolivia and Perú in 2016.

This shall be made by using common R packages:

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### Open Trade Statistics

* docs.tradestatistics.io has fully detailed explanations to use the API

* In case of not knowing the ISO codes for the country of origin or destination, I can check api.tradestatistics.io/countries and inspect it from the browser.

---

## Comparison between APIs

### Open Trade Statistics

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Function to read each combination reporter-partners
read_from_ots <- function(p) {
  fromJSON(sprintf("https://api.tradestatistics.io/yrpc?y=2016&r=chl&p=%s", p))
}

# The ISO codes are here: https://api.tradestatistics.io/countries
partners <- c("arg", "bol", "per")

# Now with purrr I can combine the three resulting datasets
# Chile-Argentina, Chile-Bolivia, and Chile-Perú
ots_data <- map_df(partners, read_from_ots)
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### Open Trade Statistics

```{r}
# Preview the data
as_tibble(ots_data)
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### Open Trade Statistics

* I got tidy data but I still cannot answer the original question.

* I can use the API again to join two tables.

* I'll obtain the product information and then I'll group the data by groups of products.

* The answer has to be *informative*

---

## Comparison between APIs

### Open Trade Statistics

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Product information
products <- fromJSON("https://api.tradestatistics.io/products")

# Join the two tables and then summarise by product group
# This will condense the original table into something more compact
# and even probably more informative
ots_data_2 <- ots_data %>%
  left_join(products, by = "product_code") %>%
  group_by(group_name) %>%
  summarise(export_value_usd = sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(-export_value_usd)
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### Open Trade Statistics

Now I can say that in 2016, Chile exported primarily vehicles to Argentina, Bolivia and Perú.

```{r}
ots_data_2
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Observatory of Economic Complexity

* This API is documented at atlas.media.mit.edu/api.

* I'll try to replicate the result from OTS API.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Function to read each combination reporter-partners
read_from_oec <- function(p) {
  fromJSON(sprintf("https://atlas.media.mit.edu/hs07/export/2016/chl/%s/show/", p))
}

# From their documentation I can infer their links use ISO codes for countries,
# so I'll use the same codes from the previous example
destination <- c("arg", "bol", "per")

# One problem here is that the API returns a nested JSON that doesn't work with map_df
# I can obtain the same result with map and bind_rows
oec_data <- map(destination, read_from_oec)
oec_data <- bind_rows(oec_data[[1]]$data, oec_data[[2]]$data, oec_data[[3]]$data)
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Observatory of Economic Complexity

```{r}
oec_data %>% 
  select(dest_id, hs07_id, hs07_id_len, export_val) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Observatory of Economic Complexity

* At first sight the API returned many more rows than in the previous example.

* To obtain the exact same result I'll need post-filtering at product code.

* One curious column in the table above is `hs07_id_len`, and it reflects length of the HS code.

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Observatory of Economic Complexity

* If you need to join that table with official HS tables, for example, in case of having to append a column with product names, exactly zero of the codes above shall have match.

* Among all HS codes, "7325" means "Iron or steel; cast articles", and that is an official code and name used by all customs in the world.

* In the OEC case, their "157325" code is actually "7325" from the HS, because they append a "15" that stands for "product community #15, metals".

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Observatory of Economic Complexity

Let's filter with this consideration in mind:

```{r}
# Remember that this is a "false 6", and is a "4" actually
oec_data %>%
  filter(hs07_id_len == 6) %>% 
  mutate(hs07_id = substr(hs07_id, 2, 6)) %>% 
  select(dest_id, hs07_id, export_val) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Atlas of Economic Complexity

* I couldn't find documentation for this API

* Still I'll try to replicate the result from OTS API (I obtained the URL by using Firefox inspector at their website

# Getting to know these codes required web scraping from http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore
# These codes don't follow UN COMTRADE numeric codes with are an alternative to ISO codes
destination <- c("8", "31", "173")

# The resulting JSON doesn't work with map_df either
# This can still be combined without much hassle
atlas_data <- map(destination, read_from_atlas)

---

## Comparison between APIs

### The Atlas of Economic Complexity

* `product_id` is of class `integer`. How about official HS codes such as `0101`? 

* Some scraping indicates that the `product_id` is linked to HS codes.

* Post-filtering is required at year as there are more years than what was requested.

# R package

## R package

Let's go easy

```r
# easy start
install.packages("tradestatistics")
```

---

## R package

With more time we should have done (but it requires `devtools` and more, and I don't want
you to spend the rest of the presentation installing packages)

```r
# reproducible start
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tradestatistics)
```

## R package

Fiji exports a lot of water. But how much of its exports to the US are actually water?

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(tradestatistics)

fji_usa <- ots_create_tidy_data(
  years = 2017, reporters = "fji", partners = "usa",
  include_shortnames = T
)
```

---

## R package

```{r}
fji_usa %>% 
  select(product_shortname_english, export_value_usd) %>% 
  arrange(-export_value_usd) %>% 
  mutate(export_value_share = round(100 * export_value_usd /
                                      sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = T), 2))
```

## R package

Which country from America is the #1 partner with the European Union (EU-28)?

```{r echo=TRUE}
ame <- ots_countries %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>% 
  select(country_iso)

eu28 <- ots_countries %>% 
  filter(eu28_member == 1) %>%

ame_eu28 <- ots_create_tidy_data(
  years = 2017, reporters = ame$country_iso, partners = eu28$country_iso,
  table = "yrp"

ame_eu28_2 <- ame_eu28 %>% 
  group_by(reporter_iso) %>% 
  summarise(export_value_usd = sum(export_value_usd, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(-export_value_usd)
